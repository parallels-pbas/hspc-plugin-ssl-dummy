<blockquote>
<p>The Dummy SSL certificate plug-in is designed to facilitate manual SSL certificates provisioning and/or SSL certificate procedures testing.  Actually the plug-in emulates Certificate authority activities.
<p>The following SSL certificate types are implemented in the Dummy SSL certificate plug-in:
<ul>
<li>No certificate is actually generated.
<li>Fake certificate. Some text is created instead of a certificate, for example, "TEST CERTIFICATE".
<li>Self-signed SSL certificate is generated. 
</ul>
